# A_company_database

This project was developed as part of units 'ICTPRG431 - Apply query language in relational databases' and 'ICTPRG432 - Develop data-driven applications' for completion of the Certificate IV in IT (programming) at NMTAFE, WA.

This program works on a paper company's database (MySQL), which stores data on clients, branches, supplies, employees, etc. The program displays all data in the database on a basic C#WPF graphic interface. The user can view, search, add, delete and update records in each table.
